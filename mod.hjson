description: "[yellow[]]Before you'll play this mod, let me tell you that [red[]]skill and patience are highly required.
[yellow[]]You need to learn from your mistakes and lost battles in order to complete some sectors.[white[]]
Welcome to the Frozen farlands,
here, where there is no such thing called heat, Serpulo's Moon Awaits you!
Zilo, a place colonized by Bushark the fraction from Tantros,
Even if that's only a moon there are many new things, new resources, blocks, units, turrets, just everything.
There is one more place we would like you to visit... Gheţar
A Lonely Asteroid orbiting behind Zilo,
Maybe it's a small place but it doesn't means it is going to be easy in there, but surely you'd be having fun...

This mod contains custom soundtracks, please do not steal them... instead get a better vibe while playing
